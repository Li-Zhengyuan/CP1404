# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Most of my estimates were not very accurate at the beginning. I often underestimated the time needed because I focused 
only on the “coding” part and forgot about debugging, reviewing, or reading instructions.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the practicals progressed, my estimates became closer to reality. I learned to break tasks into smaller parts and 
consider hidden time-sinks like reading error messages or testing edge cases. By the later weeks, my estimates were 
much more consistent and predictable.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Estimating helped me see how much time I actually spend on different stages of a task. It taught me to slow down, plan 
better, and avoid rushing. It also made me more aware of my own working habits, especially how easily small issues can 
extend the total time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Other people often notice things I completely miss—especially when it comes to readability and structure. Their 
feedback helped me realise that “working code” is not the same as “good code”, and small improvements can make a huge 
difference for clarity.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others’ code made me more critical of my own work. I started noticing patterns: repeated code, unclear 
naming, or over-complicated logic. It also gave me ideas for better ways to structure functions or handle errors. 
Reviewing others is honestly one of the fastest ways to improve myself.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[1]https://github.com/HongJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-3497730004

### Explanation

This was a good code review because I identified unnecessary repetition in the code and suggested extracting common 
logic into a separate function. My feedback was specific, actionable, and focused on improving 
readability without changing the behaviour of the program.

### Good Code Review 2

[2]https://github.com/elijahangJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/1/commits/cfec895c8f53ba88d2ca24fd8700ddf940c71000

### Explanation

In this review, I highlighted the importance of following PEP 8 formatting, especially regarding constant naming and 
function structure. This review showed that I was paying attention 
to both style and correctness, not just surface-level issues.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add a few more short examples before each practical—especially for new concepts like classes or file I/O. 
Sometimes the jump from lecture content to practical tasks felt a bit sudden, so extra small demos would help students 
warm up.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I became much better at cleaning up and organising my code. By the later practicals, I was consistently using 
functions, constants, and meaningful names. I also improved at testing my work properly before submission, which helped 
me avoid mistakes and produce more reliable programs.
